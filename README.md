## Overview

**Automation in Digital Engineering Using Data Science** is a collaborative project developed by a team of four Master’s students from the University of South Australia, class of 2024, for the John Holland Group. This project serves as a demonstration of our innovative solution aimed at automating the **Level of Development (LoD) verification process** for **Building Information Modeling (BIM)** project management within the John Holland Group.

Our solution integrates a user-friendly **Navisworks Manage 2025 plugin** with a robust **Python-based CLI application** that implements advanced LoD verification algorithms. This combination streamlines workflows, enhances accuracy, and significantly reduces manual effort in BIM project management.

## Features

- **Navisworks Manage Plugin:**
  - Seamless integration with Navisworks Manage 2025.
  - User-friendly interface for initiating LoD verification.
  - Display the verification result into Navisworks.

- **Python CLI Application:**
  - Implements sophisticated LoD verification algorithms.
  - Command-line interface for advanced users and automation scripts.

## Installation

### Plugin Installation

1. **Download the Installer:**
   - Navigate to the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo/releases) page of this repository.
   - Download the latest `mysetup.exe` file.

2. **Run the Installer:**
   - Double-click the downloaded `mysetup.exe`.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to install the plugin.
   - **Important:** Ensure you select the `Plugins` subfolder of your Navisworks Manage 2025 installation directory during the installation process.

3. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open **Navisworks Manage 2025**.
   - Navigate to the **Tool Add-ins** tab to confirm that the plugin is active.

## Usage

### Using the Navisworks Manage Plugin

1. **Launch Navisworks Manage 2025.**

2. **Access and Configure the Plugin:**
   - Click on the **Tool Add-ins** tab in the toolbar.
   - Select the **Unisa LoD Plugin** from the list of available plugins.
   - On **Setting** tab, select **Set AppData Folder** to select the folder for output. Ideally in your Document folder.

3. **Initiate LoD Verification:**
   - Select the model you wish to have verified.
   - Click on the **Setting** tab then **Run Verifyer** to start the process.
   - Upon finishing, click on the **Load Output** to select the newest output to display in Navisworks.
